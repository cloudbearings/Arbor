Arbor - Augmented Reality Web Service

Arbor is a flexible fast-response augmented reality application. Through predictive caching techniques, Arbor servers and clients are capable of predicting user movement and caching relevant data based on their geolocation information. Thewebserver component manages the accounts and data service for the augmented reality application along with the predictive caching mechanism. 

Please build and install using:
perl Makefile.PL

To start the server:
cd Arbor-Server
bin/app.pl

To create a new database:
cd Arbor-Server
perl -Ilib bin/deploy.pl

For development I now recommend using perlbrew to install your own local administrator-free copy of perl! More instructions and information at perlbrew.pl!

Arbor Server is built on the Perl Dancer framework and is currently using SQLite as the database engine. This allows for strong portability and excellent performance.

A recommended webserver is Nginx, a fast lightweight httpd server.
